## Installation

1. Firstly, you will need to create a new "bot" integration, in your slack [settings](http://my.slack.com/services/new/bot). Type a username `Office Simulator` and click "Add Bot Integration". 

2. Once the bot is created, you will be shown an `API token` ... copy this, we'll need it later.

3. Next, clone this project, or download it as a [ZIP](https://github.com/tholman/office-simulator/archive/master.zip) and extract it.

4. Open up `index.js` in the root directory, and add replace `SLACK_TOKEN` with your slack token. You can also change the channel from `general` to one of your other channels, if you wish.

5. Finally, run `npm install` and `npm start` in the project, and you should see the initial team building message.

## Note

Office simulator only posts once or twice a day, so if it doesn't seem to be constantly going, its due to painstakingly real realism.
